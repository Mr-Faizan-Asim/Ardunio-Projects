This repository contains various projects and tasks developed during my **Digital Logic Design (DLD)** and **Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL)** courses at **UET Lahore**. The projects involve different aspects of microcontroller programming, including circuit design, programming for LED lights, and WiFi-enabled lamp control. I have explored and implemented various concepts such as assembly language programming, LED control, random color generation, and communication protocols like WiFi using Arduino.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **LedLightDimAndIncrease**
   - A project where the LED light's intensity can be controlled to dim or increase.
   - This helps understand pulse-width modulation (PWM) and how to control analog output with a microcontroller.

### 2. **LightOn**
   - A simple implementation where an LED light turns on, demonstrating basic control logic using assembly language.

### 3. **SwitchCase**
   - A project where multiple states of a lamp are controlled using the `switch-case` construct in code. This demonstrates conditional branching in microcontroller programming.

### 4. **LampControler.asm**
   - Assembly language code for controlling the operation of a lamp. The project involves low-level programming, using assembly language to control hardware.

### 5. **RandomizeColorGenerate.ino**
   - This Arduino project involves generating random colors for an RGB LED. It demonstrates the use of random number generation to control LED color outputs.

### 6. **WifiServer.ino**
   - A WiFi-enabled project where the lamp can be controlled through a server using an ESP8266/ESP32 module, demonstrating basic networking concepts and communication over WiFi.

### 7. **blink.s**
   - A basic assembly program that blinks an LED, helping understand the time delays and control loops in assembly programming.

### 8. **rgbLightBlinking.ino**
   - A project where an RGB LED blinks in different colors, showing how to control multiple color channels and time delays.
